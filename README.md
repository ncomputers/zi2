# Crowd Management System Repository

This repository hosts different versions of a crowd management application.

* **zi_v_1** – initial prototype with FastAPI, YOLOv8 and DeepSORT.
* **zi_v_2** – improved dashboard with Bootstrap styling and live charts.
* **zi_v_3** – interactive dashboard with CDN styling and occupancy status.

Future versions will be added in their own folders.
